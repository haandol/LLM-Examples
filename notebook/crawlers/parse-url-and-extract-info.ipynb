He has a younger sister, Lee Eun-hee, who won the Miss Congeniality portion of Miss Korea in 1996.[6] He graduated from Hanyang University with a major in French Literature and the Graduate School of Chung-Ang University with a major in Theater and Cinematography.[5][90] In his spare time, Lee practices taekwondo.[91][92]\\nRelationships[edit]\\nLee was previously romantically linked with fellow All In lead Song Hye-kyo beginning in the early-2000s. The relationship, though kept completely low-key and rarely publicized, lasted fifteen months before they split in mid-June 2004.[93] Lee married actress Lee Min-jung on August 10, 2013, at the Grand Hyatt Seoul.[94] The couple had briefly dated in 2006, then resumed their relationship in 2012.[95] Lee\\'s wife gave birth to their only child, a son, Lee Joon-hoo, on March 31, 2015.[96] After he had to clear some debts following his father\\'s death, Lee fell into a depression. He then started to suffer panic disorders, and found it difficult to attend award ceremonies. Lee credits his wife with helping him overcome his mental health challenges.[97]\\nCivil lawsuit & habitual gambling allegations[edit]\\nOn December 9, 2009, Lee\\'s ex-girlfriend Kwon Mi-yeon filed a civil lawsuit alleging she was tricked into having a sexual relationship with the star based on the promise of marriage. She claimed Lee caused her mental anguish and physical damage along with claims that Lee is a chronic gambler and sued for 100 million won. Lee\\'s agency, BH Entertainment, countered that her claims were all false and that the lawsuit was retaliatory in nature due to the breakup. Lee countersued Kwon for defamation and extortion.[98][99]\\nShortly after the lawsuit was filed, TV show host Kang Byung-kyu appeared on the set of the TV drama Iris that Lee was working on at the time. He was accused of bringing in gangsters and causing a disturbance due to a conflict with a producer that he claimed spread rumors that Kang was behind the feud between Lee and Kwon. Due to this incident Kang was arrested on assault charges. Kang was also later indicted on charges of blackmail and defamation with prosecutors alleging that Kang and Kwon colluded to blackmail Lee for large sums of money in November 2009 before Kwon went on to file her civil lawsuit in December after Lee refused to pay.[100][101]\\nLee was cleared of the illegal gambling charges on March 19, 2010, with prosecutors citing no evidence.[102] Kwon\\'s claim for damages was eventually dropped in August 2010 due to her lack of participation in proceedings.[103] Kang was eventually sentenced to one year in prison and three years probation in 2013 on his fraud and assault charges.[104]\\nBlackmail scandal[edit]\\nOn August 28, 2014, Lee was blackmailed by singer Dahee from K-pop girl group GLAM[105] and model Lee Ji-yeon[106] for 5 billion won (about US$4,000,000) in exchange for not releasing, on the internet, a compromising video of him making sexual jokes while drinking with them on July 3.[107][108][109][110] Dahee and Lee Ji-yeon were arrested on September 1,[111] after Lee reported the crime to police when they handed him two suitcases to transport the money.[112] It was later revealed that the crime was fully intentional and pre-planned, as both Dahee and Lee Ji-yeon looked for plane tickets to escape to Europe[113] and purchased two suitcases to be used for transporting the money.[114] Moreover, the two women attempted to film an additional video of Lee hugging Lee Ji-yeon by secretly placing a smartphone in a kitchen sink, but they failed to do so.[115] However, Lee Ji-yeon claimed that the blackmailing was an impulsive act after Lee broke up with her,[116][117] for which Lee Byung-hun\\'s agency released an official statement stating that Lee had not once met her alone and that he mentioned to the two women that he wanted to stop meeting them when he sensed ulterior motives from them after talking about their financial difficulties,[114] demanding he buy them a house.[118] The final trial was held at the Seoul District Court on January 15, 2015,[119] where Dahee was sentenced to a year in jail and Lee Ji-yeon to a year and two months.[120][121] In February, following the sentencing, Lee requested a pardon for the women while the prosecution in charge felt that the sentence was too lenient.[122] In March, both women, who were in jail for six months, received a suspended sentence for two years following Lee\\'s pardon request.[123] The K-pop girl group GLAM was disbanded following the sentencing of Dahee.\\nFilmography[edit]\\nDiscography[edit]\\nAlbums[edit]\\n|Year\\n|Album Name\\n|1999\\n|Lee Byung Hun - To Me\\nSingles[edit]\\n|Year\\n|Single Name\\n|2008\\n|\"Itsuka (Someday)\"\\nSoundtrack[edit]\\n|Year\\n|Track\\n|Album\\n|2010\\n|\"Stay\"\\n|Iris OST\\n|\"Endless Road\"\\nAwards and nominations[edit]\\nNotes[edit]\\nReferences[edit]\\n- ^ \"LEE Byung-hun\". m.koreanfilm.or.kr.
